### The Art of Program Derivation and Parallel Computation
#### (Gershom Bazerman)

The file Algebraically.hs is a self-contained set of notes and exercises for this workshop. While the entire presentation can be followed with pencil and paper, it is probably a good idea to have a compiler handly to check the typedness of intermediate derivations.

Prospective attendees can get the Glasgow Haskell Compiler from the [haskell.org homepage](https://www.haskell.org/downloads).

Exercises can be done with any text editor and GHCi (the interactive shell of GHC), which is installed with the compiler.
