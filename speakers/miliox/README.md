# ooErlang: A Programmer-Friendly Approach to OOP in Erlang by [Emiliano Firmino](https://twitter.com/@EmilianoFirmino)

Object-oriented Programming (OOP) dominates the industry. Most developers have
experience with OO, but are new to functional programming. To help bring them

fully supports OO with simpler syntax than previous approaches. This talk
presents how we have implemented ooErlang and how to start using it.
