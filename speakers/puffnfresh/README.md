## Dependent types

More expressive. Who cares?

1. Correctness
2. Metaprogramming
3. More simple

## Idris

Another dependently-typed language. Who cares?

1. For writing executables
2. Tooling
3. Lots of syntactic sugar

## Exercises

### [Equals](http://bit.ly/1c8vDB8)

We'll look at how we can talk about equality using dependent types.

### [Algebraic](http://bit.ly/1GtfF1c)

We'll prove some algebraic properties of functions.

### BF

We'll write a String literal for a Turing-complete programming language.
