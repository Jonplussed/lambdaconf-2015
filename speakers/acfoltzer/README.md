Dear Cryptol Workshop attendees,

I'm very excited that you've decided to learn Cryptol. Whether
you're new to cryptography or an old hand picking up a new language,
we have a great opportunity to learn and have fun together.

To make the most of our time together, we strongly recommend having a
working installation of Cryptol on a computer you can bring to the
workshop. If you cannot bring a computer, there will be opportunities
for pair programming on exercises, but we recommend having your own
system for experiments.

To get Cryptol set up on your system, head to the Downloads page on
cryptol.net: <http://cryptol.net/downloads.html>. You'll also need to
download and install CVC4, an open-source SMT solver, in order to use
the full feature set of Cryptol:
<http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/>. Mac users can alternately install
Cryptol via Homebrew, which will automatically install CVC4 as well.

We also recommend having a text editor set up so that you can
comfortably edit Cryptol code. The installation includes an examples
directory so that you can try out your editor. If you're an Emacs
user, there is an excellent mode available thanks to Austin Siepp:
<https://github.com/thoughtpolice/cryptol-mode>.

If you're itching to get started in advance of the workshop, the
Programming Cryptol book has much of the content we'll be working on
together: <http://cryptol.net/files/ProgrammingCryptol.pdf>.

If you have trouble with any part of the setup, or have other
questions before the workshop begins, just email me at
acfoltzer@galois.com.

Thanks, and see you soon!
