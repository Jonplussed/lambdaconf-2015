### Type Theory and its Meaning Explanations (Jon Sterling)

Two readings are made available here.

The first, which I am pleased to make available after many months of work, is
**Type theory and its meaning explanations**
(`type-theory-and-its-meaning-explanations.pdf`), which is a guide to the
meaning explanations for type theory in three acts:

1. Logical Theories
2. Computational Type Theories
3. Proof Theories & Logical Frameworks

Please see the bibliography of this document for further readings. Everything
which I have cited is worth reading. Also, please contact me
(jon@jonmsterling.com) with any questions or comments you may have.

Secondly, I also provide my hand-written and color-coded "slides"
(`meaning-explanations-summary.pdf`), which give the full meaning explanations
for an extensional type theory in the style of Martin-LÃ¶f's *Constructive
Mathematics and Computer Programming*. In this document, I use an informal
notation for writing out meaning explanations to the forms of judgement which I
think is both concise and informative.
