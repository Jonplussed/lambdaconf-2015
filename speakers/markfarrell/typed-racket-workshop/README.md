# Typed Racket Workshop #

This workshop will give an introduction to Typed Racket. We will give an overview of the features of its type system, go over some examples of typing old untyped Racket code and provide some accompanying typing exercises for people to try. We will also discuss some current issues with Typed Racket, e.g. soundness and type inference bugs. Finally, we will discuss the need to add type annotations to a significant number of existing Racket modules - and try to get people interested in contributing to Typed Racket. Some prior experience using a Lisp-like functional programming language, such as Scheme/Racket, could be an asset in understanding the content of this workshop.

## Instructions

* Before beginning this workshop, please download & install [Racket 6.1.1](http://racket-lang.org/).
* After downloading and installing Racket, open up the Dr. Racket development environment.
