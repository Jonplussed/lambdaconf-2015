## What Next? 

* In the future, I'd like to try adding an experimental dependently typed functional programming language to Racket, 
  e.g. ```#lang dependent/racket```. I wouldn't want this language to try to accodomate the style that untyped Racket
  programmers program in, nor would I strive for untyped Racket code. I'm not a fan of gradual typing: I find too
  much typing to be bad, in the sense that many incorrect untyped Racket programs type check in Typed Racket 
  without having to be corrected first. Typed Racket is designed to accodomate and make the most out of sloppy thinking,
  not necessary correct or disallow it.
* I'd be interested in trying to add Haskell-style type classes and adhoc-polymorphism to Typed Racket.
* I'd be happy if you were willing to join me in pursuing these endeavours!
