This folder contains the slides for both the talk titled "A Bird's Eye View of
ClojureScript" and the workshop titled "Data-driven Webapps with ClojureScript
and Om".

## Talk

The pdf is in this folder, but the repository for the slides is
[here](https://bitbucket.org/tennety/lamdaconf2015-talk).

## Workshop

The pdf is in this folder, but the repository for the slides is
[here](https://bitbucket.org/tennety/lamdaconf2015-wkshp). There is also a code
repository associated with the workshop which we will be using to do the
various exercises. That repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/tennety/slides), and contains the instructions to get
up and running in advance of the workshop. We will not have a lot of time in
workshop for getting set up, so attendees should do this in advance to get the
maximum benefit.
